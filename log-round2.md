# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

### Day 0: October 02/10/17

**Today's Progress:** Back once again for round two!

I'm ready to get started with the camper leaderboard. Started off the day with a read of [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) to get me going.

**Thoughts:** Can I pull this off through NaNoWriMo and holidays? Yes. Yes I can.

**Link to work:** TBD
